# bevy-atlas-loader

WIP, not yet relesed...

This crate enables the developer to define a number of `TextureAtlas` for use as sprites in `Bevy`.

The atlas definition supports several styles of atlas':
1) The atlas may be specified as a grid from a texture.
2) Atlas can use random manually specified positions inside a texture.
3) An atlas can be made from a folder of textures - note this style is not supported via web.
4) (TBD) The atlas can be specified from a list of files.
